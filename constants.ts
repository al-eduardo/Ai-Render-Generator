export const BASE_RENDER_PROMPT = `Create a super realistic interior design rendering using the uploaded furniture items. Arrange them in a harmonious, modern, and cozy environment that feels functional and stylish. The space should be well-lit with plenty of natural daylight streaming in through windows, emphasizing brightness and warmth.

Focus on making the furniture the central elements of the design, integrating them naturally into the room. Use textures, shadows, and reflections to make the rendering lifelike. Add complementary d√©cor elements such as indoor plants, rugs, artworks, or lamps if needed, but always keep the uploaded furniture pieces as the main highlights.

The environment should feel welcoming, modern, and minimalistic, with Scandinavian and contemporary influences. Prioritize neutral tones, wood textures, soft textiles, and natural materials. Ensure realistic proportions and correct spatial arrangement so that the furniture looks practical and usable in a real home.

Avoid cartoonish, blurry, abstract, low-resolution, artificial, or overly stylized images. Avoid distorted furniture proportions, floating objects, or items that look computer-generated. Exclude unrealistic lighting such as neon glows, unnatural colors, or overexposed highlights. No empty white backgrounds, surreal elements, or cluttered arrangements.`;
